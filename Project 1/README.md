# Project 1

This project provides a way to visualize the popularity of New York City street trees in different boroughs of the city. The 
program uses the 2015 Street Tree Census data provided by the Department of Parks and Recreation 
(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh). Using this data and the name of a tree
specified by the user, the program generates information about the popularithy of this type of tree in each borough of New
York City.
